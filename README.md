# Lost 2 v1.1

This is a game I made with some friends back in 1999. It's pretty brutal - the graphics blow, the story and dialog are non-sensical, the interface is really rough... but I recall it being a labour of love.

We called ourselves Groovy Concepts Ltd. We thought we were the coolest. My screen name was The_Specialist (often just shortened to T_S). I'm cringing so hard right now.

The game was written in QBasic. I used the QBasic 4.5 compiler. For better or worse, I have used [Emscripten](http://emscripten.org/) and [em-dosbox](https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox/) to port them to the web. They are otherwise unchanged - warts and all.

If and when I find the source code (I'm going to search a stack of old floppies back at my parents place for it) I'll post it, and probably do a review of the code on [my blog](http://www.mikeconley.ca).

The executable shipped with two pieces of text - a Help.txt, and a Walkthru.txt (sic). I don't remember exactly why we shipped a walkthrough with the game - but maybe it's because we thought that'd be the only way to play through to the end, since the puzzle logic makes Tommy Wiseau look like Mr. Spock. I've appended the text from both files to this document. Warts and all.

On behalf of the group of pre-teens who made this game... uh, enjoy?

    ********************************LOST 2V1.1 DEMO***************
    Hey there.  Gerfy Flertmunder is back,  in his most confusing 
    adventure yet.  This is a demo of the sequal of the less than 
    successful Lost 1.  I am hoping that this game will be a little more famous
    after this demo is released.

    UPDATES:
    The last DEMO contained some bugs.  Lots of bugs,  actually.  I've fixed
    them all in this release.  In this release,  you will see:
    
    -Battles
    -Mouse Support
    -Sound Blaster Sound
    -Faster screen loading
    
    Turning on battles:
    You can turn on the battles by changing the "0" to a "1" in the
    "data.dat" file.  
    
    The Story:
    If you want to know the story,  read the README in LOST 1.  If you email
    us,  we'll send you Lost 1.
    
    PS:  Lost 1 asks you to register.  Forget about it.  We gave up making
    Money a LONG time ago.  =)  We were just kids back then.
    
    NOTE:
    This game was made on a Pentium 90 with 40 Megs of RAM.  We have no
    idea how this game will play on your machine.
    
    HOW TO PLAY:
    Go around exploring using the cursors.  When you see an object that you
    want to examine,  walk up against it,  and hit "L" for "look".
    If you see a person you want to talk to,  walk up to him/her,  and hit
    "T" for "talk".
    At anytime,  you can check you status.  Hit "S" for "Stats"
    If you see something you want to pick up,  walk up to hit,  and hit
    "G" for "Get".  You'll know if you were able to pick up the object.
    
    
    Inventory:
    Your inventory is probably the most important part of the game.
    In your inventory,  you can manipulate things that you have picked up.
    
    Picking up an item:
    Items that you can pick up,  appear on the screen as a question mark.
    Just go up to them and hit "G" for "GET".  It'll appear in your inventory.
    
    Using an item:
    If you have an item that you think could be used in that current screen,
    select it in your inventory and choose "USE".  If you can use it,  you
    will see a cutscene.  If you can't use it,  it will tell you.
    
    Combining:
    During the game,  you will have to combine 2 or more objects together.
    To do this,  select the first object,  hit "C",  and then "C" again.
    Select the item you want to combine it with.  If you can,  it will
    say so.  If not,  it will tell you.
    
    Opening:
    Choose this option to open the item you have selected.
    NOTE:  Sometimes this option is coloured grey,  indicating that the item
    can't be opened.
    
    Walkthrough:
    The ZIP file also includes a walkthrough in case you just want to see
    what the game can do,  and not have to solve all the puzzles,  or if
    you get stuck.  However, I strongly reccomend you don't read the walkthrough
    unless you get really stuck...the fun is in the solving!
    
    
    DISCLAIMER:
    We are not responsible if your computer is damaged in anyway due to the running
    of this game.
    All of the code and art you see before you is almost totally original,  except
    for the palette fading code.  (And I don't know who wrote it.)  Please don't use
    any of the code or art.  Same goes with the maps.  Thanks.
